Java port of the Selenium 2 (WebDriver) Python library for Robot Framework
==========================================================================

Introduction
------------

SeleniumLibrary is a web testing library for Robot Framework that leverages
the Selenium libraries from the [Selenium](http://docs.seleniumhq.org) project.

Version number follows Selenium's version numbers (first 3 numbers), and 4th number is reserved for e.g. issue fixes.
* More information about this library can be found in the
  [Keyword Documentation](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/github/hi_fi/robotframework-seleniumlibrary-java/2.48.2.0/robotframework-seleniumlibrary-java-2.48.2.0-libdoc.html).
* For keyword completion in RIDE you can download this
  [Library Specs](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/github/hi_fi/robotframework-seleniumlibrary-java/2.48.2.0/robotframework-seleniumlibrary-java-2.48.2.0-libdoc.xml)
  and place it in your PYTHONPATH.

This Java version of SeleniumLibrary exists because of easier dependency management when Robot Framework is used in Java-projects.

Usage
-----

This library is a direct replacement to the Python Selenium2Library.
There are almost no changes necesssary to the existing code. You 
can execute the same testcases and keywords with Python and Jython.

If you are using the robotframework-maven-plugin you can
use this library by adding the following dependency to 
your pom.xml:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.hi_fi</groupId>
        <artifactId>robotframework-seleniumlibrary-java</artifactId>
        <version>2.48.2.0</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

If you cannot use the robotframework-maven-plugin you can use the
[jar-with-dependencies](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/github/hi_fi/robotframework-seleniumlibrary-java/2.48.2.0/robotframework-seleniumlibrary-java-2.48.2.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar),
which contains all required libraries.

If you want more control and feel adventurous you could you use this
[jar](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/github/hi_fi/robotframework-seleniumlibrary-java/2.48.2.0/robotframework-seleniumlibrary-java-2.48.2.0.jar)
and provide all required libraries from this [list](DEPENDENCIES.md) on your own.

Differences
-----------

* Some keyword differences between this and [Python version](https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary) exists. (Same) keywords should be aligned in upcoming versions.

Demo
----

This is a maven project. If you have firefox installed,
you can execute the unit tests with:

    mvn integration-test
